The communication that can now be had between people that may be in entirely different parts of the world have allowed for a society that is more connected than ever before. The effects of this are seen in modern political movements.

                <h5 class="card-title">Information sharing</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Access to information has increased drastically with the development of communication of communication tech like the internet. The effects of this are more visible in the education system. Over the years, the content taught has been progressively shifted backwards teaching the younger generations harder and harder things. This is due to the simple fact that the information is constantly readily available to anyone exposing people at young ages to things their parents hadn't learned until they were older. Another place it can be seen is in the exponentially increasing speed of development of science. With the ability to share data, more people access to the information at once increasing the chance of someone being able to build on it and improve it. The result of this were drastic technological and scientific advancements made in a very short span of time.</p>

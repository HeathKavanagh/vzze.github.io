        <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is often used as an extended synonym for information technology (IT), but is a more specific    term that stresses the role of unified communications. ICT provides access to information through telecommunications. It is similar to Information Technology (IT), but concentrates mostly on communication technologies such as the Internet, wireless networks, cell phones, and other communication mediums. ICT includes any communication device or application, encompassing: radio, television, cell phones, computer, laptops, tablets, and network hardware and software, so on. ICT also provides the various services online and applications associated with them</p>

        <h4>Social networking</h4>
        <p>With the development of communication technologies, the distribution of information has become much more effective and efficient thereby improving the quality of life of humanity <sup>[1]</sup>. This has it's effect on many different areas, most notably, social networking. The communication that can now be had between people that may be in entirely different parts of the world have allowed for a society that is more connected than ever before. The effects of this are seen in modern political movements. The sharing of ideas to the world has allowed for fast developments in humanitarian issues that previously would have a hard time going through. The power of social networking is seen everywhere and is a major contributor to our development as a society</p>

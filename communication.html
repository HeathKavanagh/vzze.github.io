        <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is often used as an extended synonym
            for information technology (IT), but is a more specific term that stresses the role of unified
            communications [1]
            . ICT provides access to information through telecommunications. It is
            similar to Information Technology (IT), but concentrates mostly on communication
            technologies such as the Internet, wireless networks, cell phones, and other communication
            mediums. ICT includes any communication device or application, encompassing: radio,
            television, cell phones, computer, laptops, tablets, and network hardware and software, so on.
            ICT also provides the various services online and applications associated with them</p>
